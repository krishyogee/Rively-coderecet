Act as an expert in converting data into JSON format. You will be given the scraped content of changelogs or product updates page of a company. 
Your task is to convert only the changelogs or product updates posted after {one_week_ago} into a dictionary with the following keys and return it as a JSON string:
- 'date': The date of the changelog or product update.
- 'all_text_data': The full text of the changelog or product update.

However if this page only has a list of the blogs or pages of each update, without the actual details then return only do the following:
1. Locate the most recent update or changelog. This is usually the first item in the list of updates or changelogs.
2. Return a dictionary with the following keys and values:
- 'http_link': The url link attached to that specific changelog or product update which is most recent or which is mentioned first in the list.

DON'T RETURN ANYTHING ELSE EXPECT JSON OBJECT. STRICTLY NO EXPLANATORY TEXT.
sample output (case 1):
{{
  "date": "2023-10-15",
  "all_text_data": "Automated sequence exiting
    We've just shipped a new Exit from sequence workflow block.
    This means you can now automatically exit a record from any email sequence, ensuring you target the right people at the right time, with the right message.
    For example, if you're running a sequence to nurture users on a free trial, you can now build a workflow to automatically exit users from the sequence when they convert to a paid subscription.

sample output (case 2):

  "http_link": "https://feedback.clickup.com/changelog/2023/10/15/automated-sequence-exiting"
