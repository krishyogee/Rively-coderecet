Act as an expert in converting data into JSON format. You will be given the scraped content of changelogs or product updates page of a company. 
Your task is to convert the changelog or product update posted after {one_week_ago}, into a dictionary with the following keys and ONLY return it as a JSON string:
- 'date': The date of the changelog or product update.
- 'all_text_data': The full text of the changelog or product update.
DON'T RETURN ANYTHING ELSE EXPECT JSON OBJECT. STRICTLY NO EXPLANATORY TEXT.


sample output:
{{
  "date": "2023-10-15",
  "all_text_data": "Automated sequence exiting
    We've just shipped a new Exit from sequence workflow block.
    This means you can now automatically exit a record from any email sequence, ensuring you target the right people at the right time, with the right message.
    For example, if you're running a sequence to nurture users on a free trial, you can now build a workflow to automatically exit users from the sequence when they convert to a paid subscription.

}}

REMEMBER: YOUR OUTPUT SHOULD BE IN JSON FORMAT!!
